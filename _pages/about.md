Hi,

I'm Shangmin Guo, currently a research assistant at [Dr. Matthias Hennig](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/)'s [Neuroscience team](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/people/) from School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. My research interests include but not limited to: Evolutionary Linguistics, Grounded Language Learning, Natural Language Understanding and Disentangled  Representation. Meanwhile, I'm also working with [Prof. Kenny Smith](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~kenny/) and [Dr. Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) to explore the emergence of compositional languages in multi-agent autonomous communication systems.
