Hi,

I'm Shangmin Guo, currently a research assistant working with [Prof. Paula Buttery](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pjb48/) at [Institute for Automated Language Teaching and Assessment](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/), University of Cambridge. My research interests include but not limited to: Evolutionary Linguistics, Grounded Language Learning, Natural Language Understanding and Disentangled  Representation.
