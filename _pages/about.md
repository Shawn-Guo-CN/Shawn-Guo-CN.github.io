Hi,

I'm Shangmin Guo, currently a MSc student in School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. My reserach interests include but not limited to: Evolustionary Linguistics, Grounded Language Learning, Natural Language Understanding and Semantic Representation. I'm currently working on a fascinating project which aims at exploring the source of compositionality of the emergent languages in multi-agent autonomous communication.
